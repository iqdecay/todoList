# TodoList

This is a Todo list app that allows for adding tasks to a list, deleting and
editing them. 
It is build using a local web server, and is an exercise to test my understanding
of the http and html/template packages in Golang. 

Todo :
- [x] Display only non-empty fields
- [x] Date and time handling
- [ ] Prettier UI
- [ ] Editing tasks
- [ ] Deleting tasks
